# RhythmLines-Co

In my Art Project from the CreCoProject
I explore here the Ideas of Rhythm in
Art. A important Element of the this is
the Drawing and Constructrion with Lines.
So I experiment here with Scripts in the
Programming Enviroment Processing. The Idea
behind this Scripts is the Idea to let the
Recepient create individuel Works. So this
paradigm of Art is called multiple indivdual
Art by me. The Example Drawigs can be found here:
